# Respiratory-Hospitalizations-Predictions

## Purpose
Compiling respiratory hospitalization data from local hospitals within the Kingston, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario regions, I utilize different models to predict the future patient intakes for each region. The goal is to make accurate predictions in order to capture the underlying dynamics that dictate this elusive disease. By viewing how adjacent data correlates with respiratory diseases, such as tempurature and humidity, we can better understand what causes spikes in these hospitalization cases.
